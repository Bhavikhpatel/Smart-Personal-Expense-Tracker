## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   A free API key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <url>
    cd smart-personal-expense-tracker
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    # For Unix/macOS
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
    ```txt
    streamlit
    pandas
    plotly
    langchain
    langchain-core
    langchain-groq
    ```
    Then, install the packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    The application requires a Groq API key for the AI features. Set this key as an environment variable in your system.

    **For Unix/macOS:**
    ```bash
    export GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
    ```

    **For Windows (Command Prompt):**
    ```bash
    set GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
    ```

    **For Windows (PowerShell):**
    ```bash
    $env:GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
    ```
    > **Note:** For a more permanent solution, add the environment variable to your system's settings or your shell's profile file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`).

### Running the Application

1.  Make sure your virtual environment is activated and the environment variable is set.
2.  Run the Streamlit application from the project's root directory:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py 
    ```
    *(Replace `app.py` with the name of your Python script if it's different.)*

3.  Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
